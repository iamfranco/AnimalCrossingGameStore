# Animal Crossing Game Store

This is a C# console application that uses the [Animal Crossing Web API](https://acnhapi.com/) to allow users to search for:

1. a **fossil** by entering its name in the console
2. an **art** by entering its ID number in the console

Here we have 3 folders:

1. the `AnimalGameStore` folder contains the main C# project
2. the `AnimalGameStore.Tests` folder contains the unit test code for the `AnimalGameStore` project
3. the `diagrams` folder contains diagrams such as UML diagram and app demo gif.
